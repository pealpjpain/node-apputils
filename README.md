[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@pealpjpain%2Fapputils.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@pealpjpain%2Fapputils)

A small set of helper functions to make creating backend applications in Node.js easier.

## Sources and References

Inspired by and initial patterns taken from the [reader-critics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbmedialab/reader-critics) project. This is the modified and improved version.

The [clone](blob/master/src/stringify-clone.ts)-function is the well-known one liner from [stringify-clone](https://github.com/ahmadnassri/stringify-clone) which I reuse here because it prevents me from adding yet another dependency.

## Works In Progress

_Some things are bound to change, disappear or stop working between versions._ As long as `version number < 1.0` there will be breaking changes _without further notice._

But this should be obvious. More extensions will come as soon as I figure out the need to have them in a common module.
